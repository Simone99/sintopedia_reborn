## Introduction

[**Synthonpedia**](https://synthonpedia.org) is a free-access, community-driven web platform designed to assist chemists in retrosynthetic analysis by providing a database of synthons and their associated reactions. It is intended to complement, not replace, human expertise in synthetic planning.

This platform allows chemists to explore known synthons, analyze reaction patterns, and contribute their knowledge to improve the collective understanding of synthetic methodologies.

## Features

- 📚 **Comprehensive Synthon Database**: A curated collection of synthons and associated reactions.
- 🔍 **Powerful Search and Filtering**: Quickly find relevant synthetic methodologies.
- 🧑‍🔬 **Community Contributions**: Users can share and validate reaction data.
- 📊 **Data Visualization**: Interactive visual representation of reaction networks.
- 🖥 **Modern Web Application**: Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a fast and responsive user experience.
- 🐳 **Containerized Deployment**: Uses Docker Compose for easy setup and scalability.
- 🗄 **PostgreSQL Database**: Efficiently stores and retrieves reaction data.
- 🌐 **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Secures and optimizes web requests.

## Technology Stack
